Hi. I'm Duwayne. I built a simple REST api.

This is a project handling multiple API request, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. This is a RESTful server created with Node.js. Each POST object is placed inside a data.json file, each GET request displays whatever is inside that JSON file, each DELETE is responsible for removing the object, and finally the PUT method is responsible for changing the values and keys of the selected object.
